# Stack


// when to use array implementation of stack and when to use linked list implementation of stack?
// Array implementation is faster than linked list implementation because of the cache locality
// Array implementation uses less memory than linked list implementation because of the overhead of storing references

// the benifit of linked list implementation is that it can handle stack of strings of arbitrary size

// if you want that guantree that at every single N case your application is going to run fast enough use linked list.
